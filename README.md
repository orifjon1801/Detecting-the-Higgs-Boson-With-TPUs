#Searching for the Higgs Boson
"""
The Standard Model is a theory in particle physics that describes some of the most basic forces of nature.
One fundamental particle, the Higgs boson, is what accounts for the mass of matter. 
First theorized in the 1964, the Higgs boson eluded observation for almost fifty years. 
In 2012 it was finally observed experimentally at the Large Hadron Collider. 
These experiments produced millions of gigabytes of data.
Large and complicated datasets like these are where deep learning excels. 
In this notebook, we'll build a Wide and Deep neural network to determine whether an observed particle collision produced a Higgs boson or not.

#The Collision Data
"""
The collision of protons at high energy can produce new particles like the Higgs boson. 
These particles can't be directly observed, however, since they decay almost instantly.
So to detect the presence of a new particle, we instead observe the behavior of the particles they decay into, their "decay products".
The Higgs dataset contains 21 "low-level" features of the decay products and also 7 more "high-level" features derived from these.

#Wide and Deep Neural Networks
"""
A Wide and Deep network trains a linear layer side-by-side with a deep stack of dense layers. 
Wide and Deep networks are often effective on tabular datasets.[^1]
To speed up training, we'll use Kaggle's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), an accelerator ideal for large workloads.
